I am Protik Das. I am working as part of the HPC Infrastructure team of ebeam division in KLA corporation. We design air-gapped HPC systems for deep learning applications, the keyword being "air-gapped". We take inspirations from tools designed for cloud systems a lot. Often use them as is. Using them in an air-gapped systems has some interesting challenges. In my day-to-day life I build custom Linux OS images, write infrastructure code, design hardware system, troubleshoot existing systems, support customers. I plan to write about them here.

I did my PhD in Electrical Engineering from University of California, Riverside under the supervision of Dr. [Roger Lake](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~rlake/). My research was on theoretical material science which was funded by the semiconductor industry. I looked at a new generation of layered materials, more commonly known as 2D materials as a potential class of materials for semiconductor industry. I interned at Army Research Laboratory where I formalized a tool I wrote to streamline density functional theory calculations. I also interned at [Exabyte](https://exabyte.io/) where I did bandstructure calculations on 1000 (well almost) using cloud in a relatively short period of time.

If you are into optimizing things, I got a treat for you: [Optimization Considerations: Measure at the Browser](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2015/03/24/optimization-considerations/). This is a fascinating read about how Nick optimized his website.
