I am Protik Das. I am working as a Systems Development Engineer (SysDE) at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our team owns OEM drives within the AWS infrastructure. Yes, all of them.

Before AWS I had a short stint at [SambaNova](http://sambanova.ai). There I worked on improving the automation around the manufacturing process. Before SambaNova I worked as part of the HPC Infrastructure team of ebeam division at KLA corporation. There I designed air-gapped HPC systems for deep learning applications, the keyword being "air-gapped". We took inspirations from tools and technologies designed for cloud systems a lot. Often used them as is. Using them in an air-gapped systems had some interesting challenges. At KLA I built custom Linux OS images, wrote infrastructure automation code, designed hardware systems, worked on troubleshooting of existing systems, supported customer escalations, and more.

I did my PhD in Electrical Engineering from University of California, Riverside under the supervision of Dr. [Roger Lake](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~rlake/). My research was on theoretical material science which was funded by the semiconductor industry. I looked at a new generation of layered materials, more commonly known as 2D materials as a potential candidate for semiconductor industry. I interned at Army Research Laboratory where I formalized a tool I wrote to streamline density functional theory calculations. I also interned at [Exabyte](https://exabyte.io/) (now [Mat3ra](https://mat3ra.com/)) where I did bandstructure calculations on 1000 (well almost) using public cloud in a relatively short period of time. If you are curious about my research, feel free to visit my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RcgIf7MAAAAJ&hl=en) page.

If you are into optimizing things, I got a treat for you: [Optimization Considerations: Measure at the Browser](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2015/03/24/optimization-considerations/). This is a fascinating read about how Nick optimized his website.
